# Notice

## The docs that are here are currently just a port of my initial design plans.

Don't take these docs as written in stone. These were a basic initial plan for the development of the language through the interpreter book.

Even as I port the docs from GitHub to here I noticed that I have not adhered to my initial design plans, so I intend to take some time in the near future to set an initial design in place and then update the alpha interpreter to match this design before moving forward with this project.
